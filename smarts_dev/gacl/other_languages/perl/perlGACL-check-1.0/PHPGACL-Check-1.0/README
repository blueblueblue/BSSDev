PHPGACL-Check version 1.00
==========================

  Provides Perl connectivity to ACL's created by Mike Benoit's 
  phpGACL implementation. 

  Requires editing of the database-related variables specific
  to your installation.

  Simply use the method acl_check() to check an ACL with the same
  syntax as in phpGACL. Returns 1 for ALLOW, 0 for DENY.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, configure the database parameters in
lib/PHPGACL/Check.pm and testgacl.pl for your phpGACL installation.
Parameters should be the same as in your phpGACL installation.

Then type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

TEST

Test the package by configuring testgacl.pl. Then type:

   perl testgacl.pl

It should do exhaustive checks on your database of ARO/ACO 
combinations first, then ARO/ACO/AXO combinations. Verify that 
the results match your database.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

phpGACL 3.3.0b1 or later.
